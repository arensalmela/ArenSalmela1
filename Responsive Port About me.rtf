\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hello! My name is Aren and I am from Beverly, Massachusetts. I graduated from the University of New Hampshire in 2017. I currently work as an Account Manager for a craft beverage distributer in Massachusetts. In my spare time I love playing video games, discovering new craft beer, and binge watching new shows on Netflix. If I am able to disappear for a day, I love making my way up to Loon Mountain in New Hampshire for some snowboarding. I am incredibly excited to be a part of  the UNH Coding Boot Camp. I am hoping to learn new technical skills that can help me find a new career. }
